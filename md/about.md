A small collection of editor features to make my life a little easier.

---

### Multi-Edit Triggers

Select **multiple triggers** and use the **toggle button** to independently modify values across different triggers. Perform operations like addition and multiplication to quickly change values. Select a direction to compound operations across multiple triggers.

If multiple **different types of triggers** are selected, common properties like group ID and duration can be changed simultaneously.

### Improved Select Filter

Located in the delete menu. Filter objects not only by group and color, but also **scale, HSV, Z order, and Z layer**.

### Distribute Groups

Located in the editor pause menu. Evenly distribute a **set of groups** between the selected objects.

### Hide Trigger UI

While in a trigger popup, hold **shift** to hide the trigger UI, or enable the **Hide UI** button and move a slider.
