# NinKaz's Editor Utils

A small collection of editor features to make my life a little easier.

## Features

### Evenly Distribute Groups

Accessed via the **Random Groups** button in the editor pause menu. Evenly distributes a set of groups between the selected objects.

### Multi-Edit Triggers

Overhauls the **Edit Object** menu when selecting multiple different triggers. Allows you to change the group ID, duration, easing, and more of multiple different triggers at once.
